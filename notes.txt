-> I want a simple UI to tell about my protoflio

-> login/register account. 
-> home page simple (pie chart of portofolio commodities)
    -> commodition for now (US stockcs (ETF, or individual stocks), Gold, ID Stocks)
-> add commodities

class Commodities {
    code:
    price per share:
    type:
    fee:
}

class Investment extend Commodities {
    quantity:
    weight_type (gram for now):
}

class Gold extend Commodities {
    shares:
}

-> for fees (I will count that as loss)
-> so the total investment is the whole fee - the extra fee
-> Once sold, earned money to liquid variable. 
-> Realize: I will just make it per year since it is easier to maintain.
-> Un realized: is the current (well this is if there is the API, include P/L too)

------------
might need some API to be dynamic but not a must
